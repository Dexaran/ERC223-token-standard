/*
 * Shareable
 *
 * Based on https://github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/blob/master/wallet/wallet.sol
 *
 * inheritable "property" contract that enables methods to be protected by requiring the acquiescence of either a single, or, crucially, each of a number of, designated owners.
 *
 * usage:
 * use modifiers onlyowner (just own owned) or onlymanyowners(hash), whereby the same hash must be provided by some number (specified in constructor) of the set of owners (specified in the constructor) before the interior is executed.
